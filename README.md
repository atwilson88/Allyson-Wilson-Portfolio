## Description

Sometimes you want to learn about a person and their skills before you meet them. Sometimes a person wants to showcase their work to prove that they have the programming skills to pay the bills. This portfolio not only serves as a way to showcase the projects I work on. I will also use it as a sandbox to continue honing my coding skills and grow my tech stack. Please check out my progress throughout this journey, and feel free to give me feedback and encouragement.
